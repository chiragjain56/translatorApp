# translatorApp
This is translator platform developed by me with the help of https://libretranslate.de free api service.
A translation API is a software interface that allows developers to incorporate machine translation into their products. 
It enables applications to easily and quickly translate text from one language to another without storing or managing any translation data. 
It receives text in one language and returns the same text translated into another language.
